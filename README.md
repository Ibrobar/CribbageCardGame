Cribbage The Game!!!!

A card game created in digital form by Darrien and Ibrahim

Card game is started by running the Cribbage program. The game starts with 3 players that all start with 5 card hands. After seeing your hand each player will select a card to send to the crib. Press the number of which card you would like to send to the crib and then after each player has done so you will begin placing cards into play in the same method. Those are the unique parts of our cribbage game. The rules of Cribbage including scoring and end conditions are below.

During the first round of play, players will play cards one at a time, starting with the person to the left of the dealer. Totals of 15, runs, pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds that result from playing are immediately scored to the person who created them. The first set stops when someone has taken the total to 31, or when the current player does not have any cards that wouldn't put the total over 31. If the total is not all the way to 31, the last player who played cards may continue to play cards until the total goes to 31, or until they also cannot play. If the total gets to 31, the person who played the last card gets two points; otherwise, the person who played the last card gets one point. The total is reset to zero, and a new set of cards is played. Play continues until all players are out of cards.

The game ends when one player gets to a score of 121.
